['there was a man who lived in a beautiful valley. The valley was very special because it had many rare birds. One day, the man went outside and heard a lovely sound. It was the sound of a bird whistling. As he followed the sound, he noticed that the bird was perched on top of a tall tree. It was a rare, colorful bird! The man was very excited to see it. He watched the bird for a while and listened to it whistle. The man was so happy that he wanted to whistle too. With all his might, he tried to whistle, but there was no sound. The bird whistled louder and louder as if it was trying to help the man whistle. Finally, the man made a sound! He had learned to whistle. He was so happy he could whistle just like the bird. He whistled with the bird every day and they were happy together.', "ohn and his family were riding in the subway. John's mom and dad had taken him to a big city to show him the impressive tall buildings. The family was excited but also a bit worried. John saw many people on the subway and thought it was very exciting. The family finally arrived at their destination and started to explore. They walked around, looking at all the tall buildings. John was having a great time, but suddenly he heard a loud noise. Everyone was looking around and wondering what happened. It turns out that a fight had broken out and people were getting scared. John's mom and dad quickly tried to settle the situation. They grabbed John and hustled him back onto the subway. When they got back on the train, John was scared and disappointed that his fun day had ended so badly.", 'upon a time, there were two friends named Bob and Sarah. They liked to talk and play together every day. One day, Sarah had a question. She asked Bob, "Where do clouds come from?" Bob thought for a moment and said, "I don\'t know. Let\'s discuss it!" So they went to a very messy park and looked up at the sky. They saw lots of pretty clouds and talked about where they might come from. "Maybe the clouds come from the sky?" Sarah suggested. "Yes, that\'s a good idea," Bob agreed. But the more they talked, the more questions they had. How do clouds get up so high? Where do the clouds go when they disappear? They discussed this for a long time. But in the end, neither of them knew the answer. "Maybe we can figure it out together," said Bob. "Yes, let\'s try," Sarah smiled. And so Bob and Sarah continued to talk and think about where clouds come from. They didn\'t have all the answers, but they still had lots of fun.', 'upon a time there was a little girl called Mia. She was three-years-old and was always cuddling her cuddly rabbit. Mia was playing in her favourite park when something bad happened. She was playing with a red ball and kicked it too hard. The ball flew away and landed in a nearby bush. Mia had lost her beloved toy and she started to cry. A young man, who was nearby, heard her and asked what was wrong. Mia told him that she had lost her ball and he felt so sorry for her. He had a kind, compassionate smile on his face and gave her a big hug. So that Mia would stop crying, the man offered to take her home for a little nap. That sounded like a wonderful idea, so Mia said yes. When they got back, Mia said good-bye to the kind man and he gave her one final hug. He was so kind and compassionate. Mia was all cheered up and went straight off to bed for a nap!', 'upon a time, there was a little girl named Grace. Grace was very creative, she always thought of fun things to do. One day, Grace saw a little kitten playing outside. The kitten was chasing a ball of yarn, and Grace thought that it would be fun to match the kitten. Grace began running around, jumping up and down and waving her arms in the air! The kitten was so excited and ran to Grace, rubbing her knee with its head. Grace and the kitten played together for a long time and had lots of fun. Grace was so happy that she was able to match with the little kitten!', "upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around outside. One day, Lily found a secret hiding spot under a big tree. She was very excited and wanted to tell her friends, but she decided to keep it a secret. Days went by and Lily remained quiet about her secret spot. She would go there every day to play and have fun. But one day, Lily's friends came over to play and they couldn't find anything fun to do. They were bored and didn't know what to do. Lily remembered her secret spot and decided to show them. They were so happy and excited to have a new place to play. Lily felt happy too, knowing that she could share her secret without it being boring. From then on, Lily and her friends would play together in their secret spot every day.", "upon a time, there was a girl called Kitty. She had a thing that she loved.
